\title{Fuzzy Match Infraspecific Epithet within Species}
\usage{
fuzzy_match_infraspecies_within_species(df, target_df = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A tibble containing the species data to be matched. Must have
already passed through direct_match_infra_rank validation.}

\item{target_df}{A tibble representing the threatened species database.}
}
\value{
A tibble with two additional columns:
- `fuzzy_match_infraspecies`: Logical indicating whether the infraspecific
  epithet was successfully fuzzy matched (`TRUE`) or not (`FALSE`)
- `fuzzy_infraspecies_dist`: Numeric indicating the string distance of the match
}
\description{
Performs fuzzy matching of infraspecific epithets within an already matched
species where the infraspecific rank category (VAR., SUBSP., F., etc.) has
already been validated via direct_match_infra_rank.
}
\details{
This function assumes that infraspecific rank categories have already been
validated. It only performs fuzzy matching on the infraspecific epithet
(e.g., "ovatoformes" vs "ovatoformis") within the same rank category.
