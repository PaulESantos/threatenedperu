\usage{
direct_match(df, target_df = NULL, use_infraspecies_2 = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A tibble containing the species data to be matched.}

\item{target_df}{A tibble representing the threatened species database containing
the reference list of threatened species.}

\item{use_infraspecies_2}{Logical. If TRUE (default), attempts to match quaternomial
names with infraspecies level 2. If FALSE, only matches up to infraspecies level 1.
This should match the database capabilities (original = TRUE, updated = FALSE).}
}
\value{
A tibble with an additional logical column `direct_match` indicating whether
the name was successfully matched (`TRUE`) or not (`FALSE`).
