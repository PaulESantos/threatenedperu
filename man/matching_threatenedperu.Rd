\title{Match Species Names to Threatened Plant List of Peru}
\usage{
matching_threatenedperu(splist, target_df = "original")
}
\arguments{
\item{splist}{A character vector containing the species names to be matched.}

\item{target_df}{Character string specifying which database version to use.
Options are:
\itemize{
  \item \code{"original"} (default): Uses the original threatened species database
  \item \code{"updated"}: Uses the updated database with synonyms
}}
}
\value{
A tibble with detailed matching results including matched names, threat status,
and matching methodology information.
}
\description{
This function matches given species names against the internal database of threatened
plant species in Peru. It uses a hierarchical matching strategy that includes direct
matching, genus-level matching, fuzzy matching, and suffix matching to maximize
successful matches while maintaining accuracy.
}
\details{
The matching process follows a hierarchical pipeline with robust handling of
infraspecific ranks at two levels (when supported by the database).
